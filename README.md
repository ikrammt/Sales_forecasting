# Sales Forecasting Using Random Forest & XGBoost

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict **daily sales (in units)** for each product at each store using a Random Forest Regressor. The goal is to enable **accurate demand forecasting**, supporting better inventory planning and business growth.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Toy Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/toy-sales?select=inventory.csv)
- The dataset includes:
  - Daily sales per product and store
  - Product and store metadata
  - Cost and price info
  - Inventory records

---

## Objective

Predict the **number of units sold** on a daily basis for each product-store combination using historical trends and behavioral patterns.

## Features Used

| Feature                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `Day_of_Week`, `Month`    | Temporal information |
| `Is_Weekend`              | Binary flag for weekends |
| `Lag_1_Day`, `Lag_7_Day`  | Past sales (1 and 7 days ago) |
| `Rolling_Avg_7`           | 7-day average sales |
| `Sales_Drop_Flag`         | Flag for recent sales drop |
| `Consecutive_Zero_Sales`  | Number of consecutive days with zero sales |
| `Category_Avg_Sales`      | Avg. sales for the product's category |
| `Store_Percentile`        | Store sales percentile (relative ranking) |

## Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error
- **RÂ² Score**: Proportion of variance explained
- **Naive Baseline**: Compared to using `Lag_1_Day` as prediction
